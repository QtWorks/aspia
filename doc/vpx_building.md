VPX Building (for Windows)
=========================

*WARNING!* This guide does not claim to be complete.
His goal is to show with what parameters we build third-party projects.
To build third-party components, refer to the assembly guide for these projects.

Sequence
--------
1. You must have installed:
   - [Visual Studio 2017 (with SDK 10.0.17763.0)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
   - [MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS)
   - [YASM](http://yasm.tortall.net) (version for "general use")
3. Open "MSYS" and go to the directory with libvpx:

   <code>cd /<path_to_libvpx>/libvpx/build</code>
4. Run commands:

   <code>
   ../configure --target=x86-win32-vs15 --enable-realtime-only --enable-runtime-cpu-detect --enable-static-msvcrt
   <br/>make
   </code>
5. After that in directory "build" the project for Visual Studio will be generated.
